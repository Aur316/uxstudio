The code snippets provided demonstrate some reusable UI components. Additionally, they showcase a Webflow SSR (Server-Side Rendering) feature, allowing my client to independently edit and create new pages for their website without needing any code changes from me. The pages created in Webflow are loaded as slugs into the existing website without requiring a redeploy. Furthermore, I include a brief example of built-in email sending functionality, integrated with CAPTCHA token usage.
